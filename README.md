### Description

Following a disaster, maintaining and restoring community lifelines is a paramount task, which requires stakeholders to timely take effective response actions. During disaster response, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is a primary stakeholder that is responsible for (1) coordinating and assigning response tasks to other stakeholders and (2) allocating grants to support the impacted community. Aiming at facilitating the disaster response of FEMA and stakeholders collaboration, the objective of this project is
to (1) design a systematic approach that identifies respective stakeholdersinvolved in response tasks and (2) design a machine-learning model that performs grant program classification given requests from the impacted community. The project outcomes expect to enhance FEMAâ€™s disaster response in terms of task assignment and grant allocation.
